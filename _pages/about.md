Hello! I am Yangxiao Cai, a dedicated and enthusiastic graduate student currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering at Wuhan University. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from the same institution, where I graduated in 2024 with a GPA of 3.84/4.0. My academic training has equipped me with a robust foundation in advanced programming, machine learning, and software development, fostering my passion for innovative technologies.

My research interests lie at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence. I have authored two publications in reputable venues: one in the Journal of Systems and Software, exploring challenges and solutions in large language model (LLM) open-source projects, and another in arXiv, investigating security code review with LLMs. I'm the first author of the formal paper. These works reflect my commitment to advancing knowledge in cutting-edge domains.

Professionally, I interned at Beijing Dajia Internet Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Kuaishou) in 2023, where I contributed to the Beauty module, Face Stickers, and Special Effects Background Stickers, using C++ and QML. Additionally, I have led independent projects, such as an online taxi application built with Spring Boot microservices, and a research initiative employing a Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) to optimize microservice deployment by predicting user mobility patterns.

Beyond academics and research, I have engaged in leadership roles, serving as a Class Assistant at Wuhan University and a member of the Reasoning Society. These experiences have strengthened my organizational, communication, and teamwork skills. I am proficient in Python, C/C++, Java, and Swift, and I am fluent in Mandarin and English.

I invite you to explore my webpage to learn more about my projects, publications, and journey. Thank you for visiting!
